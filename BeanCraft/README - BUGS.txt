There are some standout bugs in Beancraft. This is to be expected as this is definetly considered pre-alpha. You cannot build on the west, southern. or bottom sides of blocks. For effective building, only build on certain sides of blocks. This may take some time to get used to.

Another bug is how underground building works. If you make a hole in the ground you cannot fill it in. Instead you must dig one block deeper, place on that block, and then you will fill in the surface block. Its hard to explain but you'll see when you launch.

The final "bug" is the infinite jump. Although some would consider this a failure to implement proper movement, I consider it a feature for getting around more efficently.
